# Bayesian-Inference-in-Python

A method of inference where the probability of a hypothesis is updated as new evidence becomes available, which essentially means that we have some kind of a hypothesis, new data comes in and then we update these hypotheses to accommodate this new data into our historical data.

-  Begin with a prior distribution processes
-  Collect data to obtain the observed distribution
-  Calculate the likelihood - how compatible is the evidence with the hypothesis
-  Obtain the posterior - the probability of our hypothesis given the observed evidence

## The Data

The data is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yersever/500-person-gender-height-weight-bodymassindex">link Kaggle</a>. It contains 500 person's gender, height, weight and body mass index.

We use height and weight as features and estimate the posterior.
